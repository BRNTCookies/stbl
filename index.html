        Sir Tim Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist best known for inventing one of the most revolutionary inventions of the 20th century, the ‘World Wide Web’ (WWW). A qualified software engineer, he was working at ‘CERN’ when he came up with the idea of a global network system. Sir Tim is also credited for creating the world’s first web browser and editor. He founded the ‘World Wide Web Foundation’ and directs the ‘World Wide Web Consortium’ (W3C). Both his parents worked on ‘Ferranti Mark I,’ the first commercial computer, which explains why Tim chose to become a software engineer and computer scientist. Not surprisingly, his idea of a global network has had a phenomenal impact on the world of information and technology. An alumnus of the ‘University of Oxford,’ he realized the need for a global communication network while working at ‘CERN.’ He came up with the idea when researchers from all over the world needed to share their data with each other. By the late-1980s, he had come up with a proposal for creating a global hypertext document system using the internet. A few more years of pioneering work in the field led to the birth of the ‘World Wide Web,’ making Berners-Lee one of the most significant inventors of the modern era.
